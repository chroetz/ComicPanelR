* merged tiff is not compressed!

o font and font size as page / global options (beware of hardcoded text height)
o merge should create image pdfs that are needed for text rendering

* global options
	- set DPI globally, not for each page;
	- i.e. use project specific defaultOpts
* interactive:
	- create user dialog to choose, e.g., resize panel 3

* Deco:
	- sine
		+ time -> frequency
		+ multiple segemnts as one time interval
		+ remove n as variable
	- zick-zack
	- bezier
* Render:
	- bug with sides draw false?
	o suffixed files -> merge info with suffix
	- always show segments and vertices
* Margin:
	o allow to extrapolate lines border lines linearly when calculating panel margin
* Effect:
	- ToPageEnd: allow to extrapolate lines linearly instead of just putting coorinates to end
	- ToPageEnd: make user specify page side (r,t,l,b)
* General:
	o allow suffix "a" to be used for "a1" and "a2"
	- !allow overwrite name in later steps -> makes multiple render examples in same folder possible
	- does Remove effect introduce problems??
	- circular panel 
	- bleed and side margin and safety as stencils?
	o pixel issue: requires magick 2.7.5
	- tutorial / description / documentation / examples / tests
	- better calculations of segments from raw graph
	- check for new segments/vertices after border effects (transformation)
	- make console output more informative
	- ? make interactive console program ? 
	- !write one opts file with opts form all steps, inserted defaults, package version info, date, ...; and allow using it as input
	- !comma separated names for sides and panels when not doing default
	- selectors for sides/segments and panels (all vertical, horizontal, ..., comma-separated)
* rename
	o sideMargin to (page) margin
	- steps:
		* put vertex (deco) and border line effects (transformation) into one (border effects)
		* margin -> panel margin 
		* effect -> panel area effect?
	- check naming of sides and segments
