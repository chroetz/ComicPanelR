* Deco:
	- sine
		+ time -> frequency
		+ multiple segemnts as one time interval
		+ remove n as variable
	- zick-zack
	- bezier
* Render:
	- bug with sides draw false?
	o suffixed files -> merge info with suffix
	- always show segments and vertices
* Margin:
	- allow to extrapolate lines border lines linearly when calculating panel margin
* Effect:
	- ToPageEnd: allow to extrapolate lines linearly instead of just putting coorinates to end
* General:
	o allow suffix "a" to be used for "a1" and "a2"
	- allow overwrite name in later steps
	- does Remove effect introduce problems??
	- circular panel 
	- bleed and side margin and safety as stencils?
	o pixel issue: requires magick 2.7.5
	- tutorial / description / documentation / examples / tests
	- better calculations of segments from raw graph
	- check for new segments/vertices after border effects (transformation)
	- make console output more informative
	- ? make interactive console program ? 
* rename
	- sideMargin to pageMargin
	- steps:
		* put vertex (deco) and border line effects (transformation) into one (border effects)
		* margin -> panel margin 
		* effect -> panel area effect?
	- check naming of sides and segments
